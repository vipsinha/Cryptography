# Access Control
restricting access to systems and data

# Physical access control
- Data Centers
- Server Rooms
- Media Storage Facilities
- Evidence Storage Rooms
- Wiring Closets

- Cybersecurity professionals should put controls in place that limit access to sensitive facilities, including data centers, server rooms, media storage facilities, evidence storage rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution runs.
- The three goals of crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) are natural surveillance, natural access control, and natural territorial reinforcement.
- Visitor access to sensitive facilities should be carefully controlled with procedures that describe who can authorize visitor access and how visitors can behave in your facilities. Visitor access should be recorded in a log, and visitors should wear badges that clearly identify their status.
- Two-person integrity requires that two people be present for any access to a sensitive area, such as where valuable items are stored. 
- Two-person control is used to control access to very sensitive functions, requiring the concurrence of two individuals to carry out an action.

# Logical Access Controls

## AUTHORIZATION
Once someone successfully authenticates to a system, authorization determines the privileges they have to access resources and information.

- Least Privilege : his principle states that an individual should only have the minimum set of permissions necessary to accom- plish their job duties.
- Segregation of Duties : The segregation of duties principle says that no single person should possess two permis- sions that, in combination, allow them to perform a sensitive operation.
- Authorization Models : 
    - Mandatory Access Control (MAC) : the operating system itself restricts the permissions that can be granted to users and processes on system resources. 
    It is used for confidentiality
    - Discretionary Access Control (DAC) : allowing users to assign access permissions to other users; the owners of files, computers, and other resources have the discretion to configure permissions as they see fit for objects that they own. 
    It is based on Availabitlity
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) : Instead of trying to manage all the permissions for an individual user, admin- istrators create job-based roles and then assign permissions to those roles.
    It is based on integrity

## ACCOUNT TYPES
Access control systems contain several types of accounts, and each category requires differ- ent types of controls.
- User Accounts : 
- Administrator Accounts / privileged account management (PAM) : every log action performed by a privileged account 
- Guest Accounts
- Shared/Generic Accounts
- Service Accounts
